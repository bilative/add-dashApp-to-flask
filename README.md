### add dash app into flask app (w same port)
I created a blog website with flask, and I realized that if I could embed my plotly dash apps into this website this could be really good. In this example I used this [plotly-dash-app](https://github.com/bilative/blog/tree/master/SistersLab/05_etkilesimli_dashboard_DATAVIZ).

Actually I have [github pages page](https://bilative.github.io/), and it is static website. Flask version is same with github-pages but as dynamic.
* There is no authentication or smth, I used a free bootstrap from internet.
* Added daily posts are in db, so they are not in this repo.
* Relating steps are only in app.py (with commends)

I wanted to do this because my dash apps and flask should be on same base port (url) when I hosted my personel website (like namesurname .com)
